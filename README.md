# Project for Employer Readiness - Duration 1-Week


## Overview

Welcome to Project 2! This is an important interview milestone in your full-stack journey: designing and building an full-stack web application as a team with KnowMoreDigital. You and your team will design and build an app using the MVC paradigm, create your own server-side API, add user authentication, and connect to a database.


## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this review:

* Full-stack applications

* [Git branching workflow](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows)

* [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

* Collaborative development

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project

* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project

* Resolve merge conflicts

* Explain agile software development

* Design, build and deploy a full-stack web application to Heroku

* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project

## Groupwork

With your team, youâ€™ll conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem. In creating your first collaborative full-stack application, youâ€™ll combine a robust back end--with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authenticationâ€”-to an intuitive front end. Youâ€™ll continue to build on the agile development methodologies youâ€™ve learned, like storing your project code in GitHub, managing your work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.

In this project, you should start from scratch. Doing so will help you reinforce your existing front-end abilities and solidify your understanding of the dynamic between the front end and back end. Also, youâ€™ve likely improved your skills since that first project, so with a stronger foundation now you can build a better application, using all of the additional practice youâ€™ve had over the last year.
